#SQL-Based Product Sales Analysis â€“ Elevvo Internship Project

This project was completed as part of my remote internship with **Elevvo**.

Using the [Chinook SQLite database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database), I performed business analysis using SQL and Python inside a Jupyter Notebook.

#Objectives

- Analyze product sales from a real-world relational dataset
- Use SQL to answer key business questions
- Apply JOINs, aggregations, and window functions to derive insights

#Tools & Tech Used

- SQLite(via `sqlite3`)
- SQL (JOINs, aggregations, window functions)
- Python + Pandas (data handling)
- Jupyter Notebook (interactive environment)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional visualization)
